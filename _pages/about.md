Welcome to Olivier Zendra’s homepage at [http://members.loria.fr/Olivier.Zendra](https://olivierzendra.github.io/) !

*This is the academic page for Olivier ZENDRA. This is very much work-in-progress.*

I’m a full-time tenured Inria researcher (Chargé de Recherche, in French) at Inria Centre at Rennes University, France. 
There, I’m currently a member of the DiverSE team [@ Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr/diverse) [@ IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/equipes/diverse) (previously I was team leader of the [TAMIS team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/tamis), and previously a member of said team).
I'm also Cybersecurity research delegate of the Inria Centre.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, as well the HDR (Habilitation à Dirigier les Recherches) in Computer Science.

I used to be at Inria Nancy – Grand Est, France, as a member of the LORIA research center (UMR 7503), as member of of the project-teams ECOO, Miro, Design, and then TRIO.

The research projects I have worked on include:
- The implementation and compilation of object-oriented languages, with a focus on optimizing for speed and memory. I’m one of the two people who created and implemented SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel Compiler (formerly SmallEiffel), during my PhD.
- Low-power and low-energy, in the context of embedded systems. I lead the software part of the Open-PEOPLE (Open Power and Energy Optimization PLatform and Estimator) project.
- Advanced visualization of software, with the VITRAIL (Advanced, Immersive and Real-Time Visualisation Software) project.
- Cybersecurity, my new focus as of 2017.
