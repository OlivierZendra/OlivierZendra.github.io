Welcome to Olivier ZENDRA’s homepage at [https://olivierzendra.github.io/](https://olivierzendra.github.io/).
*(work-in-progress)*

I’m a full-time tenured [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) researcher (Chargé de Recherche, in French) at the [Inria Centre at  Rennes University](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university), France. 

There, I’m currently a member of the DiverSE team ([@ Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr/diverse) [@ IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/equipes/diverse)). 
Previously I was team leader of the [TAMIS team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/tamis), and previously a member of said team.

I'm also Cybersecurity research delegate of the Inria Centre.

I used to be at Inria Nancy – Grand Est, France, as a member of the LORIA research center (UMR 7503), as member of of the project-teams ECOO, Miro, Design, and then TRIO.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, as well the HDR (Habilitation à Dirigier les Recherches) in Computer Science.

## Former research projects: ##
- The implementation and compilation of object-oriented languages, with a focus on optimizing for speed and memory. I’m one of the two people who created and implemented SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel Compiler (formerly SmallEiffel), during my PhD.
- Low-power and low-energy, in the context of embedded systems. I lead the software part of the Open-PEOPLE (Open Power and Energy Optimization PLatform and Estimator) project.
- Advanced visualization of software, with the VITRAIL (Advanced, Immersive and Real-Time Visualisation Software) project.
- [TeamPlay (Time, Energy and security Analysis for Multi/Many-core heterogenous PLAtforms)](https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu/index.html) EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation project that I coordinated, with 6 academic and 4 industrial partners.
