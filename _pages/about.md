Welcome to Olivier ZENDRA’s homepage at [https://olivierzendra.github.io/](https://olivierzendra.github.io/).
*(work-in-progress)*

I’m a full-time tenured Inria researcher (Chargé de Recherche, in French) at Inria Centre at Rennes University, France. 

There, I’m currently a member of the DiverSE team ([@ Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr/diverse) [@ IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/equipes/diverse)). 
Previously I was team leader of the [TAMIS team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/tamis), and previously a member of said team.

I'm also Cybersecurity research delegate of the Inria Centre.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, as well the HDR (Habilitation à Dirigier les Recherches) in Computer Science.

I used to be at Inria Nancy – Grand Est, France, as a member of the LORIA research center (UMR 7503), as member of of the project-teams ECOO, Miro, Design, and then TRIO.
